#1. Write a program that asks your name and then greets you by your name: Examples:

#If you enter Viivi as your name, the program will greet you with Hello, Viivi!.
#If you enter Ahmed as your name, the program will greet you with Hello, Ahmed!.
#a = input("Enter your name: ")
#print("hello, "+a+"!")
#2. Write a program that asks the user for the radius of a circle and the prints out the area of the circle.
#a =float(input("enter the radius: "))
#print(f"area of the circle is {3.14*a**2}")
#3. Write a program that asks the user for the length and width of a rectangle. The program then prints out the perimeter
#and area of the rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of the lengths of each four sides.
#a =float(input("length: "))
#b =float(input("width: "))
#print(f"perimeter of the rectangle is: {a * 2 + b * 2}")
#print(f"the area of the rectangle is: {a * b}")
#4. Write a program that asks the user for three integer numbers.
#The program prints out the sum, product, and average of the numbers.
#x, y, z = map(int, input("Enter three numbers: ").split())
#print(f"sum = {x+y+z}\nproduct = {x*y*z}\naverage = {(x+y+z)/3}")
